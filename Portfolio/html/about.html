            <div class="heading"><h2>about</h2></div> <br>  I am a second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a passion for web development.
            My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and
            programming languages. I am currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web
            development frameworks to build dynamic and responsive websites. My goal is to become a proficient web
            developer, creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I am eager to contribute to
            innovative projects and continuously learn about the latest trends and technologies in the web
            development field.
